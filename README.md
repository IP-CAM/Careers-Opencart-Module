* The CV/Resume is uploaded into the downloads folder within the store and a download link is created.
* The download link is then emailed to the store owner together with the name and email address of the customer.

COMPATIBILITY:
==============
Successfully tested on OpenCart Versions 1.5.1.x, 1.5.2.x, 1.5.3.x, 1.5.4.x and 1.5.5.x with various themes and vQmod Versions 2.1.x, 2.2.x, 2.3.x (optional for footer link).

INSTALLATION:
=============
1) ALWAYS make a backup of your site before applying new mods etc. Better to be safe than sorry.

2) Unzip the downloaded archive.

3) You should have a folder called careers. In this folder is a folder called catalog and vqmod folder (this is a vQmod to add a Careers link to the footer under Extras and above the link to Brands). 
   If you don't want this link there or don't have vQmod then do not upload the contents of the vqmod folder. If you want to put your 
   own link to the Careers form then this is the location to use: http://YOUR-URL/index.php?route=information/careers

4) Upload the contents of the folders (which are the folders called catalog and vqmod) to the same place you have OpenCart installed at. These are new files and no files should be overwritten.   

7) This will add the Careers form to your store. 
   If not using the vqmod you will need to put a link to it as described above so users can access it.

8) That is all.
